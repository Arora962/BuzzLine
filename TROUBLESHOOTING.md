## üîß Immediate Solutions

### 1. **Google Play Services Issue (Most Common)**
- **Problem**: Your device doesn't have Google Play Services or it's outdated
- **Solution**: 
  - Update Google Play Services from Google Play Store
  - If using an emulator, use a Google Play-enabled AVD
  - If using a Chinese phone or custom ROM, install Google Play Services

### 2. **Network/Firewall Issues**
- **Problem**: Network blocking Firebase services
- **Solution**:
  - Try different network (mobile data vs WiFi)
  - Check if corporate firewall is blocking Firebase domains
  - Ensure these domains are accessible:
    - `fcm.googleapis.com`
    - `firebase.googleapis.com`

### 3. **Firebase Project Configuration**
- **Problem**: Incorrect project setup
- **Solution**:
  - Verify `google-services.json` has correct `package_name`: `com.buzzline`
  - Check Firebase Console > Project Settings > Cloud Messaging is enabled
  - Ensure Firebase project is active (not deleted/suspended)

### 4. **Device-Specific Issues**
- **Problem**: Emulator or device limitations
- **Solution**:
  - Test on physical device with Google Play Services
  - If using emulator, create new AVD with Google APIs
